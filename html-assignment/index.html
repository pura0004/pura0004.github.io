        <p><strong>Mauritius</strong> is a small island located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I would describe my home country as a fun destination. Living in a multicultural society has enabled me to learn different cultures and languages. I speak <em>English, French, Mauritian Creole and some Hindi.</em> Well, I also love science fiction; I like to read<strong>comics, watch action movies, play video games, and cooking.</strong></p>

            <p>In addition, to my <em>nerdy personality</em>; I am a sportsperson. I like to play soccer and I'am also a <strong>Manchester United Fan</strong>. In the upcoming months,I hope to being able to play soccer matches  with my friends when this pandemic is finally over. I also look forward to this new experience at Algonquin College and in Ottawa, meeting new friends, learning new cultures and taste new food. I also hope that this <strong><em>Covid-19 pandemic </strong></em>will be over soon, and we will all be able return to our normal livesâ€¦</p>
