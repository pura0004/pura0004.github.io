        <p><strong>Mauritius</strong> is a small island located in the middle of the Indian Ocean. I would describe my home country as a fun destination. Living in a multicultural society has enabled me to learn about different cultures and languages. I speak <em>English, French, Mauritian Creole and some Hindi.</em> Well, I also love science fiction, the pop culture; also like to read <strong>manga comics, watch action movies, play video games, and cooking.</strong></p>

            <p>In addition, to my <em>nerdy personality</em>; I am a sportsperson. I like to play soccer and I'am also a <strong>Manchester United Fan</strong>. In the upcoming months,I hope to being able to play soccer matches  with my friends when this pandemic is finally over. I also look forward to this new experience at Algonquin College and in Ottawa, meeting new friends, learning new cultures and taste new food. I also hope that this <strong><em>Covid-19 pandemic </em></strong>will be over soon, and we will all be able return to our normal lives…</p>

                <li>Baking:</li>

                <p>I like to watch tv shows about baking. One of my favourite shows would be the <strong><em>'Meilleur Pàtissier'</em></strong>, on French Channel M6. My mum and I like to watch the show and try to redo the recepies at home. We find it challenging sometimes to recreate the recepies but we try to put the Mauritian touch to it.</p>
